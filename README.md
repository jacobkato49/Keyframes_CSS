animation-name: @keyframes name (remember we chose tutsFade).
animation-duration: the timeframe length, the total duration of the animation from start to the end.
animation-timing-function: sets the animation speed ( linear | ease | ease-in | ease-out | ease-in-out | cubic-bezier ).
animation-delay: the delay before our animation will start.
animation-iteration-count: how many times it will iterate through animation.
animation-direction: gives you the ability to change the loop direction, from start to end ,or from end to start, or both.
animation-fill-mode: specifies which styles will be applied to the element when our animation is finished ( none | forwards | backwards | both
